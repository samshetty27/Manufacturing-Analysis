Manufacturing Analysis: KPI Dashboard Project

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on identifying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for a manufacturing company's production processes. The goal of this project was to provide actionable insights to optimize production efficiency, quality, and overall performance.

Project Overview

In this project, I utilized data analytics tools such as SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to analyze and visualize the production data of a manufacturing company. The main objective was to identify and track key performance indicators (KPIs) that are crucial for the companyâ€™s operational success.

Key Tasks and Tools Used

Data Extraction and Preparation: Employed SQL for data extraction from the company's production database, followed by data cleaning and preparation in Excel.

KPI Identification: Identified critical KPIs, including production efficiency, defect rates, cycle time, and equipment utilization.

Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to visualize the identified KPIs, providing a clear view of production performance trends and areas needing improvement.

Reporting and Insights: Developed a comprehensive report summarizing the key findings, trends, and actionable recommendations for optimizing production processes. Repository Contents

SQL Scripts: SQL queries used for data extraction and processing.

Excel Files: Data cleaning and preparation files, including raw and processed data.

Tableau Dashboards: Interactive dashboards created in Tableau to visualize key metrics.

Power BI Dashboards: Power BI dashboards providing detailed insights into the production KPIs.

Reports: Detailed analysis reports with insights and recommendations.

How to Use

SQL Files: Review the SQL scripts to understand the data extraction and processing steps.

Excel Files: Explore the Excel files for data preparation techniques and KPI calculations.

Tableau and Power BI Dashboards: Open the .twbx (Tableau) and .pbix (Power BI) files to interact with the dashboards and explore the visualizations.

Reports: Read the reports for a detailed understanding of the KPIs and insights derived from the analysis. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in manufacturing by leveraging SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to uncover crucial KPIs that drive production efficiency and effectiveness. Feel free to explore the repository and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement!
